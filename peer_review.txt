Peer’s project: Branching-plot Novel

What is something you learned by reviewing your peer’s project?




What is something you saw in your peer’s project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

I like how much effort he put into the elaborate story (I also appreciate a good Star Wars reference). I could probably stand to be more thorough in my projects.



What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

Commenting line by line can be a good way of making sure you understand how everything works. 




What could have been clearer or better commented?

The show_location function could stand to have a few comments. The string format() method could also help give some clarity to the option printout.



Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

The quit condition is a little funky. It is probably an accident that it is working.



What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

The README.md is for the benefit of someone who is going to download and modify (or run) your code. Keeping that audience in mind should help with crafting a better README.md. It's not too bad, though.


Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

I like the creative story telling. It is also fun to see how much progress Jacob has made this semester!
